# Advent-of-Code-2023
My solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 daily challenges.

From December 1st to the 25th, a daily programming two-part challenge is uploaded to https://adventofcode.com/2023. Some of my solutions are divided into parts, while some are in the same program. The data given by each challenge is either provided in a seperate text file or is at the start of the program.

Each solution also provides a link to the original problem. All solutions are coded in Python.
